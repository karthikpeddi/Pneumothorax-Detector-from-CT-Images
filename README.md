# Pneumothorax-Detector-from-CT-Images
In this project a system is implemented in MATLAB to detect and classify the Computed Tomography (CT) images of the lungs as affected with pneumothorax or normal.

Run the main MATLAB file with 5 Images to train in the Dataset folder. Add another image to test in the same folder with a filename lexicographically largest in the folder.
The code will automatically classify the test image.
